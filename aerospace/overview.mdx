## Introduction

AeroSpace is a tiling window manager for macOS that provides powerful keyboard-driven window management. This configuration provides a comprehensive setup for managing windows, workspaces, and layouts efficiently.

## Installation

The configuration file should be placed at:

```bash
~/.aerospace.toml
```

After copying the configuration, you can edit `~/.aerospace.toml` to customize it to your preferences. If any keys are missing from your config, AeroSpace will use the defaults from `default-config.toml` as a fallback.

## Core Configuration

### Startup Behavior

<CodeGroup>
```toml Configuration
start-at-login = true
after-login-command = []
after-startup-command = []
```
</CodeGroup>

- **start-at-login**: AeroSpace automatically starts when you log into macOS
- **after-login-command**: Commands to run after login (currently empty)
- **after-startup-command**: Commands to run after AeroSpace starts (currently empty)

### Normalization Settings

<CodeGroup>
```toml Normalizations
enable-normalization-flatten-containers = true
enable-normalization-opposite-orientation-for-nested-containers = true
```
</CodeGroup>

These normalizations help maintain a clean and predictable window layout:
- **flatten-containers**: Prevents unnecessary container nesting
- **opposite-orientation-for-nested-containers**: Automatically alternates orientation for nested containers

## Window Layouts

### Layout Types

AeroSpace supports two primary layout modes:

<CodeGroup>
```toml Layout Settings
default-root-container-layout = 'tiles'
accordion-padding = 30
```
</CodeGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tiles Layout">
    The default tiling layout where windows are arranged in a grid pattern. Windows split the available space proportionally.
    
    Switch to tiles layout: `Alt + /`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Accordion Layout">
    An alternative layout with padding between windows. The accordion-padding is set to 30 pixels, creating visual separation between windows.
    
    Switch to accordion layout: `Alt + ,`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Container Orientation

<CodeGroup>
```toml Orientation
default-root-container-orientation = 'auto'
```
</CodeGroup>

The `auto` orientation intelligently adapts to your monitor:
- **Wide monitors** (wider than tall): horizontal orientation
- **Tall monitors** (taller than wide): vertical orientation

Other possible values: `horizontal`, `vertical`

## Window Gaps

<CodeGroup>
```toml Gaps Configuration
[gaps]
inner.horizontal = 0
inner.vertical = 0
outer.left = 0
outer.bottom = 0
outer.top = 0
outer.right = 0
```
</CodeGroup>

This configuration uses no gaps between windows or monitor edges:
- **inner gaps**: Space between windows (0px)
- **outer gaps**: Space between windows and monitor edges (0px)

You can customize these values to add visual separation if desired.

## Mouse Behavior

<CodeGroup>
```toml Mouse Follows Focus
on-focused-monitor-changed = ['move-mouse monitor-lazy-center']
on-focus-changed = "move-mouse window-lazy-center"
```
</CodeGroup>

The mouse cursor automatically follows focus:
- When switching monitors, the mouse moves to the center of the focused monitor
- When switching windows, the mouse moves to the center of the focused window

This creates a seamless experience where your mouse is always near the active window.

## Keyboard Layout

<CodeGroup>
```toml Key Mapping
key-mapping.preset = 'qwerty'
```
</CodeGroup>

The configuration uses the QWERTY keyboard layout preset. If you use Dvorak, change this to `'dvorak'`.
