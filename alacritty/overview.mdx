## Introduction

Alacritty is a modern, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator focused on performance and simplicity. This configuration provides a clean, customizable setup with transparent backgrounds, custom fonts, and an extensive theme system.

## Main Configuration

The primary configuration file is `alacritty.toml`, which defines window settings, fonts, environment variables, and theme imports.

### Configuration Structure

```toml alacritty.toml
general.import = [
    "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/coolnight.toml"
]

[ env ]
TERM = "xterm-256color"

[window]
padding.x = 10
padding.y = 10

decorations = "Buttonless"
opacity = 0.8
blur = true
startup_mode = "Maximized"

[font]
normal.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"
size = 16
```

## Window Settings

The window configuration creates a modern, distraction-free terminal experience:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Padding">
    10px padding on both X and Y axes provides breathing room around terminal content:
    ```toml
    padding.x = 10
    padding.y = 10
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Decorations">
    Buttonless mode removes standard window buttons for a cleaner look:
    ```toml
    decorations = "Buttonless"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transparency & Blur">
    80% opacity with blur enabled creates a modern, translucent effect:
    ```toml
    opacity = 0.8
    blur = true
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Startup Mode">
    Terminal launches in maximized mode by default:
    ```toml
    startup_mode = "Maximized"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Font Configuration

The configuration uses **0xProto Nerd Font Mono** at 16pt for optimal readability and icon support.

```toml
[font]
normal.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"
size = 16
```

<Tip>
  **Nerd Fonts** include thousands of glyphs and icons from popular collections like Font Awesome, Devicons, Octicons, and more. This makes them perfect for modern terminal applications and shell prompts.
</Tip>

### Why 0xProto Nerd Font?

- **Clear & Readable**: Designed specifically for programming
- **Icon Support**: Includes all Nerd Font glyphs for shell prompts and file managers
- **Ligature Support**: Clean rendering of programming ligatures
- **Size**: 16pt provides comfortable reading without eye strain

## Environment Variables

The configuration sets the `TERM` environment variable to ensure proper color support:

```toml
[ env ]
TERM = "xterm-256color"
```

This enables:
- Full 256-color palette support
- Proper color rendering in terminal applications
- Compatibility with modern CLI tools and TUIs

## Theme System

Alacritty uses a modular theme system through the `general.import` directive:

```toml
general.import = [
    "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/coolnight.toml"
]
```

**Current Theme**: `coolnight.toml` - A dark blue theme inspired by Aura, featuring:
- Deep blue background (`#011423`)
- Bright cyan and green accents
- Excellent contrast for long coding sessions
- Purple and blue highlights

  <Accordion title="Disable blur effect">
    Set `blur` to false if performance is an issue:
